// This is a basic Flutter widget test.

// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

    // Build our app and trigger a frame.
    // Note: MyApp is not const since it requires async initialization

    // Verify that the app loads (basic smoke test)
    // The actual test would need to mock Supabase initialization
